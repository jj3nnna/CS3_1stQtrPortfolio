# 1st Quarter Reflections  
**by: Jenna Angela Guiang of 9 - Sodium**

## 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well.  
1. **Variable Declaration**  
   I learned how to declare variables in JavaScript using 'let', 'const', and 'var'. I understood when to use each and how they affect scope. This was easy for me since we practiced it a lot in examples.  

2. **Arithmetic and Assignment Operations**  
   JavaScript operators such as '+', '-', '*', '/', '%', and assignment operators like '=', '+=', '-=' are clear to me. I got comfortable because we used them in solving different math-like problems.  

3. **Comparison and Logical Operators**  
   Operators like ==, ===, !=, >, <, and logical ones like &&, ||, and ! are used in decision-making. I know how to apply them correctly since we used them often inside if-else conditions.  

4. **Control Statements (If-Else)**  
   I understood how to use control statements to make decisions in a program. I can already write multiple and nested if-else statements without much confusion.  

5. **Loops (For, While, Do-While)**  
   I know how loops repeat code and how their syntax differs. I became confident in using them because of the exercises where we had to generate patterns or repeat calculations.

## 2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but need further practice/discussion and why.  
1. **Nested If-Else** – I can write them but sometimes get confused when conditions overlap.  
2. **Complex Conditions with Logical Operators** – I mix up the output when many && and || are combined.  
3. **While vs. Do-While Loops** – I need more practice to see clearly when to use each one.  
4. **Break and Continue in Loops** – I understand the idea but I still forget when to use them properly.  
5. **Functions with Parameters and Return Values** – I can describe them but need practice in designing functions for real problems.

## 3. Describe your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second item.  
1. I will practice writing more nested if-else problems, like grading systems, to get used to the flow.  
2. I will draw truth tables for complex conditions to avoid confusion.  
3. I will try solving the same problem using both while and do-while loops to see the difference.  
4. I will write small programs using break and continue to understand their effects.  
5. I will create functions that use both parameters and return values, so I can see how they make code shorter and reusable.

## 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why.  
**Effective Activities:**  
1. **Hands-on Coding Exercises** – They were effective because they let me apply what we learned right away.  
2. **Practice Problems in Loops and If-Else** – They helped me build confidence since repetition made the logic clearer.  

**Not Effective Activities:**  
1. **Copying Notes from the Board** – This was less effective because it did not give me enough chance to experiment with code.  
2. **Long Discussions without Examples** – Sometimes hard to follow, since I learn faster when I see and try actual code.
