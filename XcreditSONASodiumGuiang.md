## 2–4 Key Points from SONA 2025 That I Found Interesting

1. **Rice price promise: ₱20 per kilo**  
  This caught my attention because if achieved, it would really help a lot of people. But right now, it still feels far off. It’s a goal that has been mentioned before, and many are still waiting to see if it can truly happen.

2. **Talks about farm-to-market roads**  
  These projects sound helpful on paper. They’ve been mentioned in past SONAs too. Whether or not they actually reach the areas that need them most remains to be seen.

3. **Job creation to lessen the need for working abroad**  
  This is an important goal, especially for families separated due to work abroad. The idea makes sense, but there were not many clear details on how it would be done or if it's already in progress.

## 1–3 Key Points from SONA 2025 That I Found Weird

1. The SONA sounded like a campaign speech, too many promises, not enough results.  
2. He talked a lot about unity and digital progress, but didn’t say much about problems like corruption or poverty.  
3. He sounded too positive, like everything is going well, when in reality, many Filipinos are struggling every day.

## Reflection

SONA 2025 didn’t feel honest or connected to reality. Instead of giving clear results or showing real progress, President Marcos Jr. focused on making more promises. It felt like he was still asking for votes instead of doing the job he was already elected to do. The speech was full of big dreams but lacked answers to the country’s most urgent problems.

What made me frustrated was how disconnected it all felt. Many people are still jobless, hungry, or tired from the same old problems. The SONA gave more attention to apps and bridges than to justice, education, or fixing corruption. In the end, it sounded nice, but we’ve heard this before. It’s time for action, not words.
